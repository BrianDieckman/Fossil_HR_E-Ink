# Fossil_HR_E-Ink
A repository of useful Fossil Hybrid Watch stuff. Faces, documents, etc.

This repository is a central location for all my Fossil HR E-Ink watch face design stuff.

My goal is to create a Photoshop template that will make creating new faces easier. The work represented here should answer the main questions I have about the display:
Topics
1. What is the resolution of the display?
2. What is the tonal range of the display? (What value(s) in a file are displayed as white? What value(s) are displayed as black)
3. What is the tonal fidelity of the display? (Within the range, how far apart do values have to be in order to be discerned from one another)
4. How best to smoothly display gradients?
5. How best to display photos?

Research
1. Resolution: 1000pxÂ²
Observing other watch faces for download suggests a 1000x1000 pixel display. Initial testing for topics 2-4 assume this to be the case. Further research needed to verify.

2. Tonal range: XX% - YY%
Tonal range compression effectively reduces the display range to some values greater than zero and less than 100 to represent "fully white" and "fully black".

In the context of a bitmap display this would be a single threshold above and below which pixels would either be "on" or "off" usually 50%.

In the context of a grayscale display incapable of any method of interpolation, this would be an upper threshold and a lower threshold, any value below which or above which, respectively, would be represented as white or black. For instance, a 4-value display capable of White, 33%, 66% and Black might show any value between zero and 16% as white and any value between 75% and 100% as Black.

To find the thresholds, images with bars of varying intensity are placed against a white and black background. These bars are 1% apart so as to accurately find these values and "pin" them to the upper and lower thresholds of a design, ensuring that the maximum detail can be resolved at each end of the spectrum. Complicating this analysis is the E-Ink display's ability to interpolate between it's native values. (more on this later)

This becomes a somewhat subjective measure due to this interpolating feature. It varies based on viewing condition, total intensity, etc. To the best of my ability I have determined that the lowest value that can be effectively displayed without appearing solid black is about XX% and the highest value that can be effectively displayed without appearing solid white is about YY%.







The E-Ink display in the Fossil Hybrid HR is grayscale in the sense that individual pixel elements can be somewhere between fully "on" and fully "off." These are referred to as "native values." In addition, the display is capable of displaying values between the native values via interpolation through some manner of dithering. (For a given non-native value, pixels of differing native values are placed in proximity to eachother to simulate that desired value.)

It's helpful to know the aproximate native values of the display so solid colors can be chosen that have no dithering, as the relatively low resolution of the display causes dithered solid areas to look "dirty" which is sometimes undesireable.  created a series of bars of gray values against a background of both black (bottom half) and white (top half) to compare each end of this spectrum.
